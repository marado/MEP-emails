# MEP emails

Inspired by [MEPsPerCommittee](https://github.com/marado/MEPsPerCommittee), a script that helps you get all the email addresses of the MEPs that work on a particular EU Parliament Committee, [Paula Simões](https://paulasimoesblog.wordpress.com) asked me to do something similar, but for all MEPs.

As weird as it can sound, the European Parliament isn't very fond of spreading around the information about of the Members of the European Parliament e-mail addresses. However, those are an important tool for EU citizens who want to voice their oppinions and concerns to these elected members of the European Parliament.

This is a simple and ugly hack, but running this script will allow you to have a list of all MEPs email addresses.

If you don't need to be certain you have the most uptodate data, you might want to get an already generated email list [from Wikidata](https://w.wiki/HDZr).

## Notes
* Pull requests, issues, enhancements and ideas are most welcome.
* This script uses xml2csv, which is part of [xmlutils](https://pypi.org/project/xmlutils/).
* There is a WIP script, `wikidata.sh`, which can be used to help update the MEP email info on wikidata.
